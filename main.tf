# No-op machinepool module: implements the v1alpha1 machinepool role with
# no cloud and no native scaling group. autoscaling is declared (the
# contract input always exists) but not consumed: this module always sets
# the group's desired capacity from var.replicas, so it has nothing to
# ignore_changes on (machinepool.md "autoscaling").

# The stand-in for the scaling group. user_data decodes bootstrap_data the
# way a module feeding a plain user-data argument would, which proves the
# controller's base64 encoding round-trips (the value stays sensitive).
